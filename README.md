# eggshell

### Description
A bash-inspired shell that has basic functionality.

### How To Run
_Note: This can only compile on linux._
1. If you use **VS Code** then go to `tasks.json` and add `-lreadline` in `args`. This is for the readline library. You can also compile with this command `g++ main.cpp -o main utilities.cpp -lreadline`.
2. Run the program from **VS Code** or type `./main` in terminal.

### Project Status
